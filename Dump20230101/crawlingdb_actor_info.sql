She is the daughter of Lorraine Davis, an actress turned drama therapist, and veteran character actor Paul Sorvino. Her father\'s family were Italian immigrants. The young Sorvino was intelligent, an avid reader and an exceptional scholar. Her father discouraged her from becoming an actor, as he knew how the industry often chews up young stars. She attended Harvard, majoring in Chinese, graduating magna cum laude in 1989, largely on the strength of her thesis, a Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on racial conflict in China, written and researched during the year spent in Beijing, which helped her fluency in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nHowever, she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age, and moved to New York City to try her hand in the City\'s film industry, waitressing, auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s, but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Amongst Friends (1993), on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film, and, more importantly, was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received, and Sorvino\'s performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies, one a more prominent indie, Barcelona (1994), the other her first Hollywood feature, Quiz Show (1994), and her skillful performances brought her yet more attention.\n\nAn exceptionally poised and articulate young woman, she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker, but Woody Allen took the chance, and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his Mighty Aphrodite (1995) proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar (at the tender age of 29) for Best Supporting Actress. Since winning the Oscar, Sorvino has continued to take a wide range of roles, including another stretch as Marilyn Monroe in Norma Jean & Marilyn (1996), co-starring with another very intelligent and skilled young actress, Ashley Judd. Forays into action and horror, such as Mimic (1997) and The Replacement Killers (1998) show that Sorvino is not above being playful in the film roles she chooses.\n\nHowever, what forever cemented her role in popular culture was her performance as charmingly silly California beach girl Romy White in Romy and Michele\'s High School Reunion (1997), in which she and co-star Lisa Kudrow utter one hilarious absurdity after another.\n\nMira Sorvino married Christopher Backus on June 11, 2004, and the couple have four children.','1967-09-28','None',1,NULL,'nm0000227',23931,'Acting','Mira Sorvino','Tenafly, New Jersey, USA','17.431','/nThgMCWdMpNgjGmHQrKMUAYKoQa.jpg',NULL),(34,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',1,NULL,'nm2204675',1845809,'Acting','Frances Turner','New Rochelle, New York, USA','3.581','/gc89yMClEPTRmB0eIJ2hh0sQEIV.jpg',NULL),(35,0,'[\'Idrissa Akuna Elba \', \'إدريس إلبا\', \'Идрис Эльба\', \'伊德瑞斯·艾尔巴\', \'イドリス・エルバ\', \'이드리스 엘바\', \'Idrissa Akuna \"Idris\" Elba\', \'Ίντρις Έλμπα\', \'Ідріс Ельба\']','Idris Elba (born 6 September 1972) is a British television, theatre, and film actor who has starred in both British and American productions.

After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush. Stallone subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976–present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, Stallone was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. Stallone\'s film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone\'s use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his character Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nUp until 1982, Stallone\'s films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Blood’s script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film’s production. Stallone would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, Stallone would go on to become one of Hollywood\'s highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.\n\nStallone saw a decline in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, Stallone launched The Expendables films series (2010–2014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, Stallone returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought Stallone praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sylvester Stallone, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.','1946-07-06','None',2,'http://www.sylvesterstallone.com','nm0000230',16483,'Acting','Sylvester Stallone','New York City, New York, USA','43.386','/qDRGPAcQoW8Wuig9bvoLpHwf1gU.jpg',NULL),(73,0,'[\'다샤 폴랑코\']','Dascha Polanco is a Dominican American actress best known for playing the character Dayanara Diaz on Orange Is the New Black.','1982-12-03','None',1,NULL,'nm4745601',1026947,'Acting','Dascha Polanco','Dominican Republic','10.788','/hShVoLYAfqijatAp9OwrynW0JEP.jpg',NULL),(74,0,'[]','Moisés Arias (born April 18, 1994) is an American actor.

His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association\'s middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels.\n\nIn 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career. Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels, Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) kickboxing record, and a semi-contact record of 41-4.  He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981, van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn\'t good enough to get anybody\'s attention. In 1984, he got his first significant role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie, No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). The movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if van Damme did not help them to re-cut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the US shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a US box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star, Jean-Claude van Damme.\n\nHis good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), AWOL: Absent Without Leave (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Universal Soldier (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office: The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999, he remarried his ex-wife, Gladys Portugues, and restarted his lost career to attain new goals.

Meanwhile, while sitting in a café with friends, she was approached by a still photographer who asked her if she would be interested to model. Thinking she could use the pocket money, she said yes. Modeling proved to be both fun and lucrative, and very soon she did it professionally. Her modeling contracts led to commercial work, which would take her around the world. One day, a casting director saw her work and suggested she try acting instead. She was sent to London at age 19, where she quickly won an audition to appear in the new James Bond film, A View to a Kill (1985). She so loved acting that she pursued a career in that direction. After her first film, she shot a few TV dramas in London and in Dublin, but her big break came when she was cast as Austrian seductress Dr. Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).

As an actor, his work in the film Ray earned him the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a musical/comedy. He is also a Grammy Award winning musician, producing two albums which have charted highly on the Billboard 200: Unpredictable, which topped the chart, and Intuition.\n\nFoxx was abandoned seven months after birth, and was subsequently adopted and raised in Terrell by his mother\'s adoptive parents, Estelle and Mark Talley. Foxx had a strict Baptist upbringing and began piano lessons at the age of five by his grandmother\'s orders. He has often acknowledged his grandmother\'s influence in his life as one of the greatest reasons for his success. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he changed his name to Jamie Foxx, feeling that it was an ambiguous enough name to disallow any biases. He chose his surname as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Foxx starred in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, and in 1992 he made his film debut in Toys a comedy directed by Barry Levinson. Following Toys, his first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone\'s 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he portrayed a hard-partying American football player. Foxx has since evolved into a respected dramatic actor. Foxx was featured as taxi driver Max Durocher in the film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His standout performance, however, was his portrayal of Ray Charles in the biopic Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the second male in history to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray.\n\nIn September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.','1967-12-13','None',2,'http://www.jamiefoxx.com/','nm0004937',134,'Acting','Jamie Foxx','Terrell, Texas, USA','17.516','/hPwCMEq6jLAidsXAX5BfoYgIfg2.jpg',NULL),(267,0,'[\'Willem DeFoe\', \'William Dafoe, Jr.\', \'William J.

She rose to prominence during the 1960s with the comedies Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967), and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don\'t They? (1969), and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress twice in the 1970s, for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981), and The Morning After (1986). Consecutive hits Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), California Suite (1978), The Electric Horseman (1979), and 9 to 5 (1980) sustained Fonda\'s box-office drawing power, and she won a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the TV film The Dollmaker (1984).\n\nIn 1982, she released her first exercise video, Jane Fonda\'s Workout, which became the highest-selling VHS of the 20th century.

Divorced from her second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by Stanley & Iris (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the hit Monster-in-Law (2005). Although Georgia Rule (2007) was her only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included The Butler (2013), This Is Where I Leave You (2014), Youth (2015), Our Souls at Night (2017), and Book Club (2018). In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 49-year absence from the stage, in the play 33 Variations which earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, while her major recurring role in the HBO drama series The Newsroom (2012–14) earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he is tied with Ric Flair for the most world championship reigns in professional wrestling history.\n\nBorn and raised in West Newbury, Massachusetts, Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a career as a bodybuilder. He transitioned to professional wrestling in 1999 when he debuted for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW). He signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 2001, where he was initially assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).

The next year, he won the WWE Championship for the first time, and his character subsequently transitioned into a clean-cut \"Superman-like\" hero. He then led the company as its franchise player, and public face for the next decade.\n\nA joint-record 16-time world champion, Cena has won the WWE Championship thirteen times, a record for the title. He is also a five-time United States Champion, a four-time world tag team champion, a two-time Royal Rumble match winner, a one-time Money in the Bank match winner, and has headlined several major WWE pay-per-view events, including their flagship event, WrestleMania, five times.

The Kansai region Pinky Ribbon Awards chose Hanazawa for Best Supporting Actress in 2005, and Outstanding Performance by an Actress in 2007.\n\nHanazawa began working in adult videos at least as early as December 2003 when she took part in the \"train molester\" video Chikan deruta haji tai for the Starboard studio.

During 2004 Hanazawa performed in 20 of these theatrical pink film releases. Her performance in Akira Katō\'s Teacher with Beautiful Skin: Big Tit Vibe-Torture, earned her the Best Actress, 2nd place award at the 2005 Pink Grand Prix ceremony.\n\nIn his book Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema, Jasper Sharp uses one of Hanazawa\'s scenes in Yutaka Ikejima\'s Family Gets Rude Chapter 1: Perverts\' Fun to illustrate the creative means pink film directors employ to suggest more than is legally possible in Japanese softcore pornography. Hanazawa masturbates in a scene that Sharp characterizes as \"pretty lewd\", yet she is seen only in soft focus in the background. The foreground focus of the camera is a bouquet of flowers, behind which the masturbating Hanazawa moans, \"Look at my flower!\"\n\nBesides Imaoka and Ikejima, other major pink film directors in whose films Hanazawa has appeared include Toshiki Satō, Tetsuya Takehora, Yumi Yoshiyuki, Sachi Hamano, and Yoshikazu Katō. Katō\'s Molester\'s Train: Sensitive Fingers gave Hanazawa a second appearance in a Pink Grand Prix Best Film-winner.

He is often noted by critics for his chameleonic performances in diverse roles and distinctive blue eyes. A native of Cork, Murphy began his performing career as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play Disco Pigs in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and UK film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the post-apocalyptic film 28 Days Later.\n\nMurphy is best known for his work with director Christopher Nolan, where he appeared as the villain Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow in all three films in the Dark Knight trilogy. Murphy has also worked with Nolan on Inception and Dunkirk. In 2013, Murphy started working on a TV show for BBC titled “Peaky Blinders” as the show’s lead role, Thomas Shelby. The show is still airing as of 2020 with five highly critically acclaimed seasons under its belt A resident of London since 2001, Murphy often works in or near the city and has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood. Uncomfortable on the celebrity circuit, he customarily gives interviews about his work, but does not appear on television talk shows or discuss details of his private life with the press.\n\nBorn in Douglas and raised in Ballintemple, two suburbs of Cork, Cillian Murphy is the eldest of four children. His father, Brendan, works for the Irish Department of Education and his mother is a French teacher. Not only are his parents educators, but his aunts and uncles are also teachers, as was his grandfather. Musicianship also runs in the family, and Murphy started playing music and writing songs at age ten. In mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time live-in girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, an artist whom he met in 1996 at one of his rock band\'s shows. The couple live in northwest London with their two sons Malachy (born in 2005) and Aaron (born in 2007).\n\nMurphy is known for being reluctant to speak about his personal life. He frequently gives interviews about his work but did not appear on a single live TV chat show, where actors customarily share information about their private lives, until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland\'s RTÉ to promote Perrier\'s Bounty. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone.

His other early film appearances were made under his birth name, William Fox (the main character in The Magnet in 1950)\n\nIn 1962, Fox was working in a bank when Tony Richardson offered him a minor role in the film The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. Fox\'s father attempted to forbid this, claiming that his son had no talent for acting and that it would disrupt his life for him to give up his job in the bank, nevertheless, Fox took the part.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Fox gained popularity. In 1964, he won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his role in The Servant (1963).\n\nOn 16 June 1965 Ken Annakin\'s Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines was released. In this British period comedy film, Fox is featured among an international ensemble cast including Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, Robert Morley, Terry-Thomas, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fröbe and Alberto Sordi. The film, revolving around the craze of early aviation circa 1910, is about a pompous newspaper magnate (Morley) who is convinced by his daughter (Miles) and fiancée (Fox), a young army officer, and they organize an air race from London to Paris, where he decides to race. A large sum of money is offered to the winner, hence it attracts a variety of characters who participate. The film received positives reviews, described as funny, colourful and clever, and capturing the early enthusiasm for aviation.\n\nIt was treated as a major production, one of only three full-length 70 mm Todd-AO Fox releases in 1965 with an intermission and musical interlude part of the original screenings. Because of the Todd-AO process, the film was an exclusive roadshow feature initially shown in deluxe Cinerama venues, where customers needed reserved seats purchased ahead of time. The film grossed $31,111,111 theatrically and on home video $29,950,000. Audience reaction both in the first release and even today is nearly universal in assessing the film as one of the \"classic\" aviation films.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia','1939-05-19','None',2,NULL,'nm0289038',1292,'Acting','James Fox','London, England, UK','13.826','/usTO4NoD08rV0woh7vXLX8gxzHO.jpg',NULL),(2076,0,'[\'Mohinder Purba\', \'Roy Deep\']','Mohinder Purba, better known as Deep Roy, is a Kenyan actor, stuntman and puppeteer of Indian descent.','1957-01-01','None',2,NULL,'nm0746989',1295,'Acting','Deep Roy','Nairobi, Kenya','6.391','/hXq63dj4WjwcKann7h9Wy7z7Ac7.jpg',NULL),(2077,0,'[]','Mexican actress of film and television.

When he was 16 years old, Fagbenle landed his first proper role in a Nigerian adaptation of the William Shakespeare play Macbeth. Originally hired to play the saxophone, Fagbenle was also given several lines in the play, and he knew at that moment that acting was his calling. The director was so impressed by Fagbenle\'s work, by the second revival of the play he had secured the lead role.

These were followed by the more famous Sizwe Banzi is Dead and The Island, co-written with Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona, in the early 1970s. He also received an Olivier nomination for his role in My Children My Africa! Kani\'s work has been widely performed around the world, including New York, where he and Winston Ntshona won a Tony Award in 1975 for Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island. These two plays were presented in repertory at the Edison Theatre for a total of 52 performances. Nothing but the Truth (2002) was his debut as sole playwright and was first performed in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. This play takes place in post-apartheid South Africa and does not concern the conflicts between whites and blacks, but the rift between blacks who stayed in South Africa to fight apartheid, and those who left only to return when the hated regime folded. It won the 2003 Fleur du Cap Awards for best actor and best new South African play. In the same year he was also awarded a special Obie award for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the USA.

He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997).\n\nAfter the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008).\n\nIn the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors\' projects, including the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes.\n\nDiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness.

Bana performs predominantly in leading roles in a variety of low-budget and major studio films, ranging from romantic comedies and drama to science fiction and action thrillers.\n\nEric Bana was the younger of two children; he has a brother, Anthony. He is of Croatian ancestry on his father\'s side. Bana\'s paternal grandfather, Mate Banadinović, fled to Argentina after the Second World War, and Bana\'s paternal grandmother emigrated to Germany and then to Australia in the 1950s with her son, Ivan (Bana\'s father). His father was a logistics manager for Caterpillar, Inc., and his German-born mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser. Bana grew up in Melbourne\'s Tullamarine, a suburban area on the western edge of the city, near the main airport. In a cover story for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. \"Wog is such a terrible word,\" he said.

I have always been in the company of people of European origin\".\n\nShowing acting skill early in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather\'s walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try stand-up comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne\'s Castle Hotel.

Born in New York City and raised on Long Island, Lohan was signed to Ford Models at the age of three. Having appeared as a regular on the television soap opera Another World at age 10, her breakthrough came in the Walt Disney Pictures film The Parent Trap (1998). The film\'s success led to appearances in the television films Life-Size (2000) and Get a Clue (2002), and the big-screen productions Freaky Friday (2003) and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004). Lohan\'s early work won her childhood stardom, while the teen comedy sleeper hit Mean Girls (2004) affirmed her status as a teen idol and established her as a Hollywood leading actress.\n\nLohan became known as a triple threat after signing with Casablanca Records and releasing two studio albums, the platinum-certified Speak (2004) and gold-certified A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005).

In order to showcase her range, Lohan began choosing roles in independent films such as A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby (both 2006) and Chapter 27 (2007). Her reported behaviour during the filming of the dramedy Georgia Rule in 2006 marked the start of a series of personal struggles that would plague her life and career for most of the next decade. She became a fixture in the tabloid press for her frequent legal issues, court appearances and stints in rehabilitation facilities. This period saw her lose several roles, negatively impacting her career and public image. In an attempt to return to acting, she appeared in Liz & Dick (2012) and The Canyons (2013), but were both met with negative reviews.\n\nIn 2013, under the guidance of Oprah Winfrey, Lohan filmed the docu-series Lindsay (2014), which depicted her returning to work.

Rasuk attended performing arts school as a teenager, and began acting at 14. He garnered his first movie role at 16 in Five Feet High and Rising. The film—less than 30 minutes long—was a hit at the Independent Spirit Film Festival. Two years later, the same director, Peter Sollett, suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length movie: Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, Rasuk played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven with Orlando Bloom. In 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva, one of the leading roles. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stunt men (including the scenes of surfing at Pacific Ocean Park pier and skating in empty swimming pools), Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen. Believing he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, Rasuk fractured one of his orbital bones. Rasuk says the accident likely earned him more respect from serious skaters within the cast and crew.

Jones attended Hollywood High School and, at 15, took over the role of Henry Aldrich on the hit radio show \"The Aldrich Family.\" He learned carpentry and augmented his income with jobs in that field. He served in the Army in Alaska during the final months of World War II. Gene Autry, who before the war had cast Jones in several Westerns, put him back to work in films and particularly in television, on programs produced by Autry\'s company. Now billed as Dick Jones, the handsome young man starred as Dick West, sidekick to the Western hero known as The Range Rider (1951), in a TV series that ran for 76 episodes in 1951 (and for decades in syndication). Then Autry gave Jones his own series, Buffalo Bill, Jr. (1955), which ran for 40 episodes. Jones continued working in films throughout the 1950s, then retired and entered the business world.\n\nDate of Death: 7 July 2014, Northridge, Los Angeles, California','1927-02-25','2014-07-07',2,NULL,'nm0427934',67371,'Acting','Dickie Jones','McKinney, Collin, Texas','3.979','/iwrrMhI8A6HMk9iH039N7DSLu5A.jpg',NULL),(2452,0,'[\'Clifton Avon Edwards\', \"Cliff \'Ukulele Ike\' Edwards\", \"Cliff \'Ukelele Ike\' Edwards\", \'Ukulele Ike\', \'Ukelele Ike\']','From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nClifton Avon \"Cliff\" Edwards (June 14, 1895 – July 17, 1971), nicknamed \"Ukulele Ike\", was an American musician, singer, actor and voice actor, who enjoyed considerable popularity in the 1920s and early 1930s, specializing in jazzy renditions of pop standards and novelty tunes.

While at Columbia, Yune won the role of Romeo in an off Broadway production of Romeo and Juliet and was later signed to a talent manager. Karl continued to work as a theater actor in New York City and won critical and rave reviews for his performance as Gloucester in a contemporary rendition of Shakespeare\'s Richard the III. While casting The Last Samurai, director Edward Zwick was impressed with Yune\'s audition tape and Karl went to Los Angeles for the first time to meet with the famed director. Zwick later informed Karl that the studio was to cast the film out of Japan, but encouraged Karl to move to Los Angeles as he saw promise in the young actor\'s talent. Inspired, Karl moved to Los Angeles, only to learn that he was offered a five year contract back in New York, on the popular daytime TV drama All My Children. Yune passed on the offer and soon booked his first lead role in the cult film Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid. The following year Karl was picked by producer Steven Spielberg to play the memorable role of Koichi, the secret lover to Li Gong\'s Geisha Hatsumomo, in Memoirs of a Geisha, based on the international best selling novel. Karl continued to work in lead and supporting roles in award winning independent, foreign, and Hollywood films. In 2010, Karl was again chosen by producer Steven Spielberg and director Shawn Levy to star as Tak Mashido, the reclusive legend of the robot fighting world in the sci-fi drama Real Steel. Karl now resides in Los Angeles, California. His brother Rick is also a successful actor in Hollywood.','1975-04-16','None',2,NULL,'nm1400085',19860,'Acting','Karl Yune','Washington, District of Columbia, USA','3.088','/4GI4p5aPfW0vI20IdJOcxD5BEqr.jpg',NULL),(2568,0,'[]','','1999-07-17','None',1,NULL,'nm1053641',1126350,'Acting','Sophie Levy','Toronto, Canada','7.288','/ytDkZ3NrpxWayURhHuI2Dtp29TM.jpg',NULL),(2569,0,'[]','','2001-06-30','None',1,NULL,'nm8175959',2108181,'Acting','Ines Høysæter Asserson','Oslo, Norway','5.694','/fs2Kgd4RpfiWxHXulX1wnRAknjq.jpg',NULL),(2570,0,'[\'Veslemøy Evenstad Mørkrid\']','',NULL,'None',1,'https://www.morkrid.com/','nm3943964',1349664,'Acting','Veslemøy Mørkrid',NULL,'3.196','/kRp7lr5GRipPU8qb5Cg32zjoIW0.jpg',NULL),(2571,0,'[\' Elli Rhiannon Müller\', \'Elli Rhiannon Müller Osbourne\']','Elli Rhiannon Müller Osborne is a Norwegian actress, known for Utøya: July 22 (2018), Hope (2019), Vikingulven (2022), and the Netflix movie Royalteen (2022).',NULL,'None',1,NULL,'nm9602953',1964704,'Acting','Elli Rhiannon Müller Osborne',NULL,'8.238','/2BDD5ruypc9TaNbwlq5b5UCqTah.jpg',NULL),(2572,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',0,NULL,'nm12747082',3613558,'Acting','Mathias Storhøi',NULL,'0.6',NULL,NULL),(2573,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',0,NULL,NULL,2077911,'Acting','Sunniva Lind Høverstad',NULL,'1.388','/w9dNk6oNOO4rEKiclfmNF65qjW9.jpg',NULL),(2574,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',0,NULL,NULL,3581448,'Acting','Pål Richard Lunderby',NULL,'0.6',NULL,NULL),(2575,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',1,NULL,NULL,2967367,'Acting','Amalie Sporsheim',NULL,'7.313','/tgN6Zy0jYlGdWGn9Lgo2xhsvFqP.jpg',NULL),(2576,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',0,NULL,NULL,3613559,'Acting','Filip Bargee Ramberg',NULL,'0.6','/kHvul9jNaLtSr0pCAdkQXXSO4lh.jpg',NULL),(2577,0,'[]','',NULL,'None',0,NULL,NULL,1853993,'Acting','Martin Grid Toennesen',NULL,'0.84',NULL,NULL),(2578,0,'[]','Madison Wolfe is an actress.','2002-10-16','None',1,NULL,'nm4068901',1330999,'Acting','Madison Wolfe','Metairie, Louisiana, USA','8.585','/soxY60lFZp2TeTZa3Rt6UUkzfYb.jpg',NULL),(2579,0,'[\'Frances O’Connor\', \"Φράνσις Ο\'Κόνορ\", \"Φράνσις Αν Ο\'Κόνορ\"]','Frances Ann O\'Connor (born 12 June 1967) is a British-Australian actress and director.

She comes from a family of artists; beside her father and mother, her two half brothers are Arthur H and Kên Higelin. She was influenced by music from an early age when her father introduced her to jazz and British pop music. At the age of seven, she formed a duo with her father; she provided the vocals while he played piano.\n\nWhen she was 13 Izïa started to take an interest in rock bands such as Nirvana and Led Zeppelin. At this time, she wrote her first song, titled \"Hey Bitch\", which later featured on her debut album.\n\nA year later she met Caravan Palace bassist Antoine Toustou through her parents and the pair played their first live show in 2004. Six months later, her backing group was expanded to three people when Izïa and Toustou were joined by Sébastien Hoog and Vincent Polycarpe. She left school at the age of 15 in order to concentrate on a career in music.\n\nIn 2006, Izïa released her first extended play and the following year she opened for Iggy & the Stooges at the Printemps de Bourges music festival. She consequently embarked on a tour of France, which consisted of over thirty dates. On 8 June 2009, her eponymous debut studio album, Izia was released in France. In some reviews, the album garnered comparisons to Janis Joplin. The album performed reasonably well in the French albums chart, achieving a peak position of #31 and staying in the top 100 for 17 consecutive weeks.\n\nIzïa has since released three more albums that reached the charts in France: So Much Trouble (2011), La Vague (2015), and Citadelle (2019). In 2021, Izïa contributed a cover of the Metallica song \"My Friend of Misery\" to the charity tribute album The Metallica Blacklist.\n\nIzïa made her film debut in 2012, appearing in the film Bad Girl under her full name, Izia Higelin.

She is one of the highest-paid actresses in the world and is cited in the media as one of the nation\'s most popular and attractive personalities. Padukone has established a career in Hindi films, and is the recipient of several awards, including three Filmfare Awards. Padukone, the daughter of the badminton player Prakash Padukone, was born in Copenhagen and raised in Bangalore. As a teenager she played badminton in national level championships, but left her career in the sport to become a fashion model. She soon received offers for film roles, and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the Kannada film Aishwarya. Padukone then played a dual role in her first Bollywood release —the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om— and won a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. The 2012 box office hit Cocktail marked a turning point in Padukone\'s career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. She rose to prominence with starring roles in the comedies Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), Chennai Express (2013), and Happy New Year (2014), and the historical romance Bajirao Mastani (2015), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films.

He wanted to become a teacher, like his father, so began a degree in French at the University of Ulster. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical Up on the Roof (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O\'Donnell in Hear My Song (1991).\n\nNesbitt got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama Cold Feet (1998–2003), which won him a British Comedy Award, a Television and Radio Industries Club Award, and a National Television Award. His first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer \"Pig\" Finn in Waking Ned (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, Nesbitt was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In Lucky Break (2001), he made his debut as a film lead playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played Ivan Cooper in the television film Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 shootings in Derry. A departure from his previous \"cheeky chappie\" roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a British Independent Film Award and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.\n\nNesbitt has also starred in Murphy\'s Law (2001–2007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy—a role that was created for him by writer Colin Bateman. The role twice gained Nesbitt Best Actor nominations at the Irish Film & Television Awards (IFTA). In 2007, he starred in the dual role of Tom Jackman and Mr Hyde in Steven Moffat\'s Jekyll, which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination in 2008. Nesbitt has since appeared in several more dramatic roles; he starred alongside Liam Neeson in Five Minutes of Heaven (2009), and was one of three lead actors in the television miniseries Occupation (2009) and The Deep (2010).

In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.\n\nChan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul\'s residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school\'s best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.','1954-04-07','None',2,'http://jackiechan.com','nm0000329',18897,'Acting','Jackie Chan','Victoria Peak, Hong Kong','59.043','/nraZoTzwJQPHspAVsKfgl3RXKKa.jpg',NULL),(3388,0,'[]','','1995-08-24','None',1,NULL,'nm3924219',1443364,'Acting','Wenwen Han','Xi\'an, Cina','5.272','/m9e60jjEgd6yg9lnHCM84wtrzFU.jpg',NULL),(3389,0,'[\'Yu Rong-Kwong\', \'于榮光 \', \'Yu Rong-Wang\', \'Yu Yung-Kang\', \'Yu Wing-Kwong\', \'Yu Wing-Kong\', \'Rong-Guang Yu\', \'Ringo Yu\', \'Yu Rongguang\', \'于荣光\']','Yu Rong-Guang is a Chinese actor and martial artist from Beijing who started his career in Hong Kong.

He had a long tenure in the World Wrestling Federation as a performer and color commentator, and was inducted into the Federation\'s Hall of Fame in 2004. Apart from wrestling, Ventura also pursued a film career, appearing in films such as Predator (1987). Ventura first entered politics as Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, from 1991 to 1995. Four years after his mayoral term ended, Ventura was the Reform Party candidate in the Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998, running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual ads that urged citizens not to \"vote for politics as usual\". Ventura\'s campaign was successful, with him narrowly and unexpectedly defeating both the Democratic and Republican candidates. The highest elected official to ever win an election on a Reform Party ticket, Ventura left the Reform Party a year after taking office amid internal fights for control over the party. As governor, Ventura oversaw reforms of Minnesota\'s property tax as well as the state\'s first sales tax rebate. Other initiatives taken under Ventura included construction of the METRO Blue Line light rail in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, and cuts in income taxes.

Stardom followed several years later with her acclaimed role in The Last Picture Show (1971), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her next appearance in The Exorcist (1973), earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The film has remained popular and several publications have regarded it as one of the greatest horror films of all time. She followed this with Martin Scorsese\'s Alice Doesn\'t Live Here Anymore (1974), which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nShe appeared in numerous television films and gained further recognition from her performances in Same Time, Next Year (1978), which won her a Golden Globe Award, and Resurrection (1980), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), and Requiem For a Dream (2000). For playing a lonely drug-addicted woman in the last one of these, she was again nominated for an Academy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In the 2010s, she made appearances in television series including the political dramas, Political Animals and House of Cards, which have earned her Emmy Award nominations. Since 2000, she has been co-president of the Actors Studio, a drama school in New York City.

He also played the role of Willy Loman in the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller\'s 1949 play Death of a Salesman under the direction of Elia Kazan. On television, Cobb costarred in the first four seasons of the popular, long-running western series The Virginian. He typically played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but often had roles as respectable figures such as judges.  Born Leo Jacob in New York City, he grew up in The Bronx,  before studying at New York University and making his film debut in The Vanishing Shadow (1934).  Cobb performed in numerous theater productions and companies, including Group Theatre (New York) before serving in the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Force during World War II.  \n\nFollowing the war, Cobb returned to film, television and theater before being accused of being a Communist in 1951 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee by Larry Parks, himself a former Communist Party member. Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until, with his career threatened by the blacklist, he relented in 1953 and gave testimony in which he named 20 people as former members of the Communist Party USA. Following the hearing he resumed his career and worked with Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, two other HUAC \"friendly witnesses\", on the 1954 film On the Waterfront, which is widely seen as an allegory and apologia for testifying.  His 1968 performance as King Lear achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.  One of his final film roles was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist.\n\nCobb died of a heart attack in February 1976 in Woodland Hills, California, and was buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Growing up in poverty in Port Said, Sayed Badreya\'s dreams of movie stardom looked as bleak as the prospect of peace in the Middle East. From the Six Day War in \'67 through the Yom Kippur War in \'73, his only escape from the world he knew was the movie theater, where films transported him to a magical land. But it was here that he determined he was destined to be a part of that magic.  After attending New York University film school, and then moving to Hollywood, Sayed first worked in the film industry as an assistant to actor/director Anthony Perkins, and then with director James Cameron on True Lies.  His mission - to make movies that told the Arabic- American story, since it had yet to be told - led to the creation of his own production company, Zoom In Focus. Under this banner, he directed and produced the documentary, Saving Egyptian Film Classics as well as The Interrogation, which won Best Creative Short Film at New York International Film Festival. He also produced and starred in Hesham Issawi\'s short, T for Terrorist, which was awarded Best Short Film at the Boston International Film Festival and the San Francisco World Film Festival. In 2007, he played his first leading role in the English language motion picture American East, a film that he also co-wrote.  2008 was Sayed Badreya\'s breakout year. He captivated audiences as Abu Bakaar, the villainous arms dealer who kidnaps Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the summer\'s blockbuster Iron Man. Also that year, Sayed played the comedic Palestinian cab driver opposite Adam Sandler in You Don\'t Mess with the Zohan.  This summer, Sayed can be seen in Paramount Pictures\' feature film El traspatio aka Backyard, directed by Oscar-nominated Carlos Carrera in which he plays a serial killer opposite Ana de la Reguera. Sayed can also be seen this summer in Movie 43, where he plays opposite Halle Berry. Additional forthcoming films include The Three Stooges, his fifth film with the Farrelly brothers; The Dictator, playing Sascha Baron Cohen\'s father as the original Dictator, and Just Like a Woman, with Oscar nominated director Rachid Bouchareb. Also, Sayed is going to a new frontier in the new video game Uncharted 3, playing Ramses the Great Pirate Captain.  Most recently he completed his second leading role in the New York independent feature, Cargo, about human traffickers, directed by Yan Vizinberg. And he just finished co-starring opposite Oscar-nominated actress Melissa Leo in film The Space Between, directed by Travis Fine.  Sayed has also worked as an actor, Arabic dialect coach, and Islamic technical advisor on Path to 9/11, a $40 million mini-series about the events leading up to 9/11 produced by ABC/Touchstone.  Sayed\'s efforts to bring attention to Arab-Americans in the motion picture industry have received much coverage over the years on radio, television, and in major publications around the world, such as The New York Times, GQ, NPR, ABC\'s \"Politically Incorrect\" with Bill Maher, BBC\'s \"Panorama,\" CNN, \"Fox Report with Shepard Smith\", The Hollywood Reporter and Egypt Today.','1957-05-01','None',2,'http://www.sayedbadreya.com/','nm0046223',173810,'Acting','Sayed Badreya','Port Said, Egypt','2.722','/sVvwmMsjXd5YqyZEfWcWQEkBScu.jpg',NULL),(3688,0,'[\'王延龙\', \'Wang Yan-Long\']','',NULL,'None',0,NULL,NULL,2722311,'Acting','Wang Yanlong',NULL,'1.96','/y1tZ8HgVhohel8h0HQLVLr2Dcn2.jpg',NULL),(3689,0,'[\'Nicola Anne Peltz\', \'Νίκολα Πελτζ\', \'Nicola Peltz Beckham\']','Nicola Peltz (born January 9, 1995) is an American film and television actress, best known for playing Katara in M.

He has done different roles, from lighting and props to  stage manager and set and script supervisor.\n\nLam gradually developed an interest in acting and by his own account,  pestered various directors until they relented and gave him tiny roles.  There are two pivotal persons in Lam\'s acting career. The first is Stephen Chow, who befriended him in his early days as a crew member and cast him in movies like The God of Cookery (1996) and Kung Fu Hustle.\n\nThe second person is director Johnnie To. Lam has been in over 80 films since 1996 and at least 20 of those have been directed or produced by To.\n\nKnown for his weight and size, his roles are often as a bumbling  secondary character providing comic relief from the most intense nature  of To\'s films.

She would further lampoon her nepotistic image in her own satirical comedy series So NoTORIous, which debuted in 2006.\n\nBut in the second half of the aughts, Spelling’s personal life began to overshadow her acting work, with an on-set affair with actor Dean McDermott resulting in both Spelling and McDermott divorcing their respective partners at the time.

It was released on February 13, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. Chapa will begin filming the only film about Marlon Brando ever to be made, in June 2010 called Brando Unauthorized. He followed this with \"Vatos Locos\", starring himself. Albert Pyun was supposed to direct, but left the project following a dispute over his salary, so Chapa directed himself. The film is about the Chinese mafia in Los Angeles and how the Mexican gang boys, known as \"vatos,\" fought back and defeated the Chinese gang-bangers.\n\nAs of 2011, Chapa has yet another project in development, an indie drama titled \"The Best So Far,\" which takes place in the late 80\'s, about a small-town Canadian girl who loves Judo and dreams about being one of the finalists at the \'88 Olympics. The ensemble drama follows the lines of Rocky, in the sense that it\'s not about winning, but going the distance and getting your life back. Chapa, who wrote the drama, will play the widowed father, who does his best to make life easier for his daughter. Although the film is in its very early development stages, Chapa hopes the script will attract the interest of talented artists such as Ellen Page for the main role and Jennifer Connelly for the supporting role, this being the part of the final, toughest competition Page\'s character faces off during the \'88 Olympics and gets defeated by. Although not winning, she gets her sense of victory be offering a brave stand against the better fighter, and both discover, in the process, they are quite simillar, despite their differences. Insiders who had a chance to read the script stated that it is one of the finest not-yet-filmed scripts they had ever seen.

Parnell is currently one of the lead voices on the FX animated comedy Archer. In 2010, Parnell starred alongside his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz in the Comedy Central series Big Lake.\n\nAfter performing as a company player with The Groundlings for a number of years, Parnell was hired to join the cast of Saturday Night Live as a featured player on September 26, 1998, and was promoted to repertory player the following season. In the summer of 2001, budget cuts and hiring four new cast members required Lorne Michaels to dismiss two cast members; he chose to lay off Parnell and Jerry Minor over Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, and Maya Rudolph.\n\nWhile on SNL, Parnell appeared in numerous sketches, and commercial parodies, and performed memorable impressions of various celebrities. One of his most popular sketches is Lazy Sunday, a rap video he shot with Andy Samberg about buying cupcakes and going to see The Chronicles of Narnia. He has also performed raps about hosts Jennifer Garner, Britney Spears, Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Lorne Michaels announced that four cast members would be fired due to budget cuts, but he did not say who. On September 22, 2006 it was announced that three cast members had been fired: Parnell, Horatio Sanz, and Finesse Mitchell. This effectively made him the only SNL performer to have been fired twice by Lorne Michaels, though Parnell did say in a 2008 interview with The Sound of Young America podcast that he was okay with being let go this time, because he was considering leaving after that season anyway, but added that he probably would have stayed one last season if he was asked back. He had been with SNL for eight seasons; at the time only four people (Darrell Hammond, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, and Al Franken) have been cast members longer. He has since made uncredited cameo appearances on the show, most recently in 2008 parodying newscasters Tom Brokaw, Jim Lehrer, and Bob Schieffer.\n\nParnell and his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz recently starred together in Big Lake, a 2010 sitcom on Comedy Central from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.\n\nHe also recently appeared as Dr. Drummer/Santa in the SyFy Holiday Special episode from the television show Eureka, which aired on December 7, 2010 (Season 4 Episode 10).','1967-02-05','None',2,NULL,'nm0663177',51382,'Acting','Chris Parnell','Memphis, Tennessee, USA','21.068','/aGzA5l9S89qLkhpSdjmkerFdZt0.jpg',NULL),(4211,0,'[]','','1984-06-06','None',2,NULL,'nm1601147',1561268,'Acting','Brandon Scott Jones','Bel Air, Maryland, USA','3.699','/lgw6q8nuBLDet1VUIEbuS5FX9eJ.jpg',NULL),(4212,0,'[\'Marlon Brando Jr.\', \'Bud\', \'Марлон Брандо\', \'マーロン・ブランド\', \'말론 브란도\', \'มาร์ลอน แบรนโด\', \'مارلون براندو\', \'马龙·白兰度\', \'მარლონ ბრანდო\']','Marlon Brando Jr. (April 3, 1924 – July 1, 2004) was an American actor. Considered one of the most influential actors of the 20th century, he received numerous accolades throughout his career which spanned six decades, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and three British Academy Film Awards. Brando was also an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences.\n\nHe initially gained acclaim and his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams\' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received further praise, and a first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz\'s 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James A. Michener\'s 1954 novel.\n\nThe 1960s saw Brando\'s career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola\'s The Godfather (1972). He got the part and subsequently won his second Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. He declined the Academy Award due to alleged mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972), Brando reestablished himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\n\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in supporting roles, such as Jor-El in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and Adam Steiffel in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days\' work on Superman.\n\nBrando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century.

His final HBO special, It\'s Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death.\n\nIn 2004, Carlin placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ahead of Lenny Bruce and behind Richard Pryor.  He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live.

She has also been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, LGBT rights activist, television producer and collaborative partner in the LGBT family vacation company R Family Vacations.\n\nRaised Roman Catholic, O\'Donnell lost her mother to cancer as a pre-teen and has stressed the importance of protecting children and supporting families throughout her career. O\'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show Star Search when she was twenty years old. A TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience and in 1996 she started hosting The Rosie O\'Donnell Show which won multiple Emmy awards.\n\nDuring her years on The Rosie O\'Donnell Show she wrote her first book, a memoir called Find Me and developed the nickname \"Queen Of Nice\" as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts. She used the book\'s $3 million advance to establish her own For All Kids foundation and promoted other charity projects encouraging other celebrities on her show to also take part. O\'Donnell came out stating \"I\'m a dyke!\" two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to gay adoption issues.  O\'Donnell is a foster—and adoptive—mother. She has since continued to support many LGBT causes and issues.\n\nIn 2006 O\'Donnell became the new moderator on The View boosting ratings and attracting controversies with her liberal views, and strong personality, dominating many of the conversations. She became a polarizing figure to many and her strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies including an on-air dispute regarding the Bush administration\'s policies with the war in Iraq resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007 O\'Donnell also released her second memoir, Celebrity Detox, which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at The View. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues. She is best known for her inaccurate prediction that Donald Trump will never be the President of the United States. In 2008 O\'Donnell starred in and executive produced America (2009 film), a Lifetime channel original movie in which she plays the therapist of the title character, a 16-year-old boy aging out of the foster care system. The film is based on the E.R.

He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.\n\nTony Blair was elected Leader of the Labour Party in the leadership election of July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under his leadership, the party adopted the term \"New Labour\" and moved away from its traditional left wing position towards the centre ground. Blair subsequently led Labour to a landslide victory in the 1997 general election. At 43 years old, he became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair\'s government implemented a number of 1997 manifesto pledges, introducing the minimum wage, Human Rights Act and Freedom of Information Act, and carrying out devolution, establishing the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nBlair\'s role as Prime Minister was particularly visible in foreign and security policy, including in Northern Ireland, where he was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. From the start of the War on Terror in 2001, Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of US President George W. Bush, notably by participating in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair is the Labour Party\'s longest-serving Prime Minister, the only person to have led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour Prime Minister to serve consecutive terms more than one of which was at least four years long.\n\nHe was succeeded as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown. On the day he resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East. In May 2008, Blair launched his Tony Blair Faith Foundation.

He has said that he \"grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides\". He decided to become an actor when he was 14 years old when he joined his high school\'s drama club. He attended the John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center in Los Angeles, where he was signed by an agency manager and began to audition for commercials.\n\nStanfield\'s first role was in the short film Short Term 12 (2009), which was filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton\'s thesis project at San Diego State University, and won the Jury Award for U.S. Short Filmmaking at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. A year later, he appeared in the short film Gimme Grace (2010), before he gave up acting for several years. He went on to work a number of different jobs—roof work, gardening, at AT&T, and at a legal marijuana factory—before he was contacted by Cretton to reappear in a feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12, his first feature film. For the duration of the film\'s production, Stanfield practiced method acting, distancing himself from the other cast members like his character, Marcus. He was the only actor to appear in both the short and feature films.\n\nShort Term 12 won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, and Stanfield was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.

He is known for his unique filmmaking process, such as disregarding storyboards, emphasizing improvisation, and placing the cast and crew into similar situations as characters in his films.\n\nHerzog started work on his first film Herakles in 1961, when he was nineteen. Since then he has produced, written, and directed more than sixty feature films and documentaries, such as Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972), The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974), Heart of Glass (1976), Stroszek (1977), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), Fitzcarraldo (1982), Cobra Verde (1987), Lessons of Darkness (1992), Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997), My Best Fiend (1999), Invincible (2000), Grizzly Man (2005), Encounters at the End of the World (2007), Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), and Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2010).

Couture is the first fighter to hold two UFC championship titles in two different divisions (heavyweight and light heavyweight). Couture has competed in a record 15 title fights. He also holds the most title reigns in the UFC with five. His last fight with Lyoto Machida put him in a tie with Matt Hughes in having the highest number of fights in the UFC at 24. Couture is one of the first members of the UFC Hall of Fame and many consider him to be one of the greatest in MMA history. Couture is currently ranked as the #10 Light Heavyweight fighter in the world by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nCouture was an Olympic wrestling alternate and has lived in Corvallis, Oregon, throughout much of his career, where he served as an assistant wrestling coach and a strength and conditioning coach for Oregon State University. He established Team Quest with Matt Lindland and Dan Henderson, a training camp for fighters, based out of Gresham, Oregon, and headed by coach Robert Folis. In 2005, Couture moved to Las Vegas, where he opened his own extensive chain of gyms under the name Xtreme Couture. He currently trains at his Las Vegas-based gym. Couture also partnered with Bas Rutten in the opening of Legends Gym in Hollywood, California.\n\nCouture is generally recognized as a clinch and ground-and-pound fighter who uses his wrestling ability to execute take downs, establish top position and successively strike the opponent on the bottom. Couture has also displayed a variety of skills in Boxing, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu; submitting three opponents using different chokeholds. Couture is the only athlete in UFC history to win a championship after becoming a Hall of Fame member and is the oldest title holder ever (in the UFC and MMA).

Austin wrestled for several well-known wrestling promotions such as World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and most famously, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which later became World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. Billed as \"The Most Popular Superstar in WWE History\", he gained significant mainstream popularity in the WWF during the mid-to-late 1990s as \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, a disrespectful, beer-drinking antihero who routinely defied his boss, Vince McMahon. This defiance was often shown by Austin flipping off McMahon and incapacitating him with the Stone Cold Stunner, his finishing move. McMahon inducted Austin into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009. Austin held nineteen championships throughout his professional wrestling career, and is recognized by WWE as a six-time world champion, having held the WWF Championship on six occasions, and the fifth Triple Crown Champion. He was also the winner of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament, as well as the 1997, 1998 and 2001 Royal Rumbles. He was forced to retire from in ring competition in early 2003 due to a series of knee and neck injuries sustained throughout his career. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as the Co-General Manager and \"Sheriff\" of Raw. Since 2005, he has continued to make occasional appearances. In 2011, Steve Austin returned to WWE to host the reality series Tough Enough.  On August 14, 2002, Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, 2002, and was given a year\'s probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service.] Marshall told Fox News that Austin beat her three times and that the 2002 incident was the result of roid rage. She also stated that WWE knew of the abuse, working to conceal the bruises on her face, and kept her from revealing that Austin hit her, as it would cost the company millions of dollars.\n\nDuring his early years as a wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after his neck injury against Owen Hart in 1997, he changed his style from technical to brawler. His most famous finishing move is the Stone Cold Stunner, or simply Stunner. During his time as The Ringmaster he used the Million Dollar Dream as finisher, since it was Ted DiBiase\'s finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the Stun Gun as finisher\n\nOne of Austin\'s taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger.

At age seven, she appeared in her first film, Men in White  (1934), as an extra. During the next two years, she had uncredited  appearances in six more films until she received her first major role in  King of Hockey (1936). Warner Brothers Studios gave significant screen time to Gillis in this movie, in hopes that she would become another Shirley Temple.  Although (like all child stars of the 1930s) she never achieved  Temple\'s level of fame, for the next several years Gillis starred in  many films, almost always playing a spoiled, bratty character. She had  two rare sympathetic roles as Becky Thatcher in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) and as the title character in Little Orphan Annie  (1938). One scene in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer called for her to go  into screaming hysterics when her character was trapped in a cave of  bats, and Gillis delivered in a powerful performance that is probably  the most memorable scene of her film career. As Gillis grew older,  however, her career slowed down, and she left Hollywood in 1947. When  she left Hollywood she married Paul Ziebold and had 2 sons. She then  divorced, relocated to New York City and married Richard Fraser,  a Scottish-born actor (they had a son born in 1958). During the 1950s  and \'60s, Gillis made sporadic television appearances, and in 1959, she  hosted a national telecast presentation of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.  Gillis and her husband moved to England in 1961, and they were living  in London when they heard of a casting call for 2001: A Space Odyssey  (1968) that called for an American actress living in the city. Gillis  auditioned and got the role; it remains her final film to date. Ann moved to Belgium in 1972 where she met and married Belgian René Van Hulst (deceased 1999).  She lived in Belgium from 1972 to 2014 and became a Belgian citizen, devoting much of her time to painting and music, she was an accomplished pianist and harpist. She moved to England, UK in December 2014 and passed away peacefully on 31/1/2018.','1927-02-12','2018-01-31',1,'http://www.1canhelp.com/ann_gillis/','nm0319268',107445,'Acting','Ann Gillis','Little Rock, Arkansas, USA','4.941','/vFaBH7EuS8hEOO4R76V5Tm2aRG9.jpg',NULL),(5227,0,'[]','Tim Davis was born on February 29, 1928 in San Francisco, California, USA.','1928-02-29','2013-03-07',2,NULL,'nm0205561',31707,'Acting','Tim Davis','San Francisco, California, USA','1.467',NULL,NULL),(5228,0,'[]','','1915-05-26','2004-07-28',2,NULL,'nm0249855',31705,'Acting','Sam Edwards','Macon, Georgia, USA','2.682','/743x0QFbc8TkmbpDbxUTZ5izSgv.jpg',NULL),(5229,0,'[\'Lee Seon-gyun \', \'Ли Сон Гюн\', \'Seon-gyun Lee\', \'이선균\', \'Lee Sun Gyun\', \'李善均\']','Lee Sun-kyun (이선균) is a South Korean actor.

Her favorite genres to act in are: horror, comedy, drama, and improv. Also, Genoveva has always been a huge fan of horror and the supernatural, so her transition into acting in the horror genre was very natural for her. She is mostly known for her horror films, but has branched out a quite bit in her selection of roles. She\'s played a sexy Satanist, a séance leader, a demon, a pregnant hippie, a mother, a hired assassin, a murderer, a witch, a fortune-teller, a doctor at a mental asylum, a reporter, a zombie, a vampire, a member of the National Guard, a sexy model, and a whole bunch more. So far it\'s been an exciting ride and a fabulous opportunity to challenge herself as an actress and to expand her horizons as an adventurer. Genoveva loves the excitement of trying on a new character and really getting inside that person\'s head. Some of the films you can look for Genoveva in are: Herschell Gordon Lewis\' Bloodmania, Take 2: The Audition (with Tyler Mane,) Apocalypse Kiss(with Michael Berryman, D.C. Douglas, and Tom Atkins), Tapestry (with Stephen Baldwin, Tina Louise, and Burt Young), A Dark Place Inside, I Spill Your Guts, Hunters (with Linnea Quigley), Agraphobia: Fear of Sexual Assault, Scotomaphobia: Fear of Blindness, Cool As Hell, Blood Slaughter Massacre, Jack \'O\' Slasher, Witchs Blood, and many more. Outside of the horror genre you can find her in the genres of drama, thriller, and comedy. In addition to being a professional actress, she is also a model of both photography and fine art. Interestingly enough, Genoveva has also always had a fascination with mysticism and the occult; she is a professional psychic reader specializing in tarot, runes, palms and crystals.

The key to this success was his retention of iconic status and popularity in Europe, especially the United Kingdom, where he received the 1994 Brit Award for best-selling album and single, appeared in the 1997 film Spice World, and ranks 23rd for the number of weeks spent on the UK charts, as of 2006.

Famous for playing comedic \"blonde bombshell\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, as well as an emblem of the era\'s sexual revolution. She was a top-billed actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200 million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021) by the time of her death in 1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a major icon of pop culture. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her sixth on their list of the greatest female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Monroe as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in a total of 12 foster homes and an orphanage; she married at age sixteen. She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don\'t Bother to Knock. She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to becoming a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films.\n\nBy 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the film noir Niagara, which overtly relied on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". The same year, her nude images were used as the centerfold and on the cover of the first issue of Playboy. She played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in The Seven Year Itch (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career.\n\nWhen the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe\'s contract, she founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying method acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and her first independent production in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959), a critical and commercial success.

Born in Italy, she was raised in the Children of God cult, before her American parents fled back to the USA when Rose was 10 amid concerns about the community.\n\nSettling in Oregon, McGowan was bullied at school and rebelled against her family. At 15, she legally emancipated herself from her parents and lived in a squat with drag artists, before moving to Los Angeles to try her hand at acting. Commercials, extra work and a small part in 1992’s \'Encino Man\' followed, but McGowan walked away from the industry, deciding to work in cosmetology instead.\n\nIn 1994, while standing outside of an LA gym with a moody demeanor, she was discovered by a casting director for Gregg Araki’s \'The Doom Generation\', believing she’d be perfect for the role of Amy Blue, an apathetic gen-X femme fatale. Her performance became synonymous with 90s punk cool, and she was nominated for Best Debut Performance at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nLanding an agent, McGowan quickly found further roles, among them parts in the slasher hit \'Scream\' and cult indies including \'Jawbreaker\', \'Going All the Way\', and \'Devil in the Flesh\'. With her pale white skin and blood-red lipstick, along with a relationship with controversial rock star Marilyn Manson, McGowan was promoted as a bad girl sex symbol for the 1990s, but began to struggle finding mainstream success.\n\nOn advice from her management, McGowan joined the cast of the fantasy drama \'Charmed\' in its fourth season, replacing the departed Shannen Doherty as one third of a trio of sister witches. After five seasons on the series, McGowan returned to film with roles in Brian De Palma’s \'The Black Dahlia\' and the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez double bill \'Grindhouse\'.\n\nWhile \'Grindhouse\' garnered McGowan international attention, particularly for her role as a go-go dancer with a machine gun for a leg, it was an unhappy period in her personal life. A relationship with Rodriguez imploded, a car accident forced her to undergo extensive reconstructive surgery, and her father died.\n\nIn 2015, McGowan announced that she was walking away from acting to explore other ventures, due to her own traumatic experiences in the industry and her frustration with the quality of work promoted by Hollywood.\n\nHer filmmaking debut, the short film \'Dawn\', premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival to rave reviews, and in the same year she released her debut single — an atmospheric slice of electronica called RM486.
